# Shorts
- We all know , shorts get a lot of views & therefore subs .
- We don't exactly know why YT is promoting shorts so much but it's got to do something with retention rates
- People really click on them cause of their short duration but actually end up scrolling for hours
- because eeach video releases a lot of dopamine ! 
- we can get bored of watching a single video for 2 hours but we can watch 100 different videos for 2 hours.
- I analysed a lot of creaters who uplod shorts daily & found out some ways to succeeed in it .

### Listicle Videos
- A lot of channels like Apna College make Listicle Videos 
- like 3 things you need to know b4 ... , 5 things to always carry when going out etc.
- Try speaking fast or make it 2x to include more information !
- you have 60 secs / 120 secs I'm taking 60 secs here.
- Divide the video into parts of 15 secs 
- make templates : so first 7 secs would be the title of the video , prerecord this : last 7 secs should be CTA like subscribe & stuff (or that's 1 min c u 2morrow)
- in the remaining 45 secs you have 2 tell 3 things or 5 things !
- Editing can come in handy to fit in a lot of info + adding visuals to support your message but can be omitted 
- you need to make a script ! & that too should be really really concise !
